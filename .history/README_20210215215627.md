FAST FOOD SIMULATOR APP
Tier: 3 — Advanced

Fast Food app simulates the operation of a simple take-away restaurant and is designed to help the developer put their knowledge of Promises and SOLID design principles to work.

This app simulates customers of a take-away restaurant placing orders and and waiting for them to be prepared and delivered to a pickup counter. After placing the order the customer waits on the order to be announced before picking it up and proceeding to the dining area.

The user stories that make up this app center around four distinct roles:

User — the end user using the application
Customer — the simulated Customer
Order Taker — the simulated Order Taker
Cook — the simulated Cook
Server — the simulated Server
This app has quite a few User Stories. Don’t be overwhelmed though. Take the time to sketch out not just the UI, but how the different actors (roles) interact and incrementally build the app following Agile principles.

Constraints
Order tickets can be represented as two different types of Promises — one the Server waits on while the Cook prepares the order and another the Customer waits on while in the serving line.
Use the native equivalent of JS Promises in whichever language you choose to develop in. JS developers should use native Promises and not async/await.
Create this app using native language features. You may NOT use a simulation package or library.
New customers arrive in the order line at a fixed interval of time. In other words, new customers arrive at a constant rate.
Order tickets are fulfilled at a fixed interval of time as well. They are completed at a constant rate.
User Stories
Application Operation

User can see an input area that allows the entry of the time interval for customer arrival and a time interval for the fulfillment of an order ticket by the cook.
User can see a customized warning message if the customer arrival interval or the order fulfillment interval is incorrectly entered.
User can start the simulation by clicking on a Start button.
User can see an order line area containing a text box showing the number of customers waiting to place orders.
User can see an order area containing text boxes showing the order number currently being taken.
User can see a kitchen area containing a text box showing the order number that’s being prepared and a text box listing the waiting orders in sequence, along with a count of the number of waiting orders.
User can see a Pickup area containing a text box showing the order number that’s currently available for pickup by the Customer and a text box showing the number of Customers waiting in the serving line.
User can stop the simulation at any time by clicking a Stop button.
Bonus features
User can specify how long it takes for an Order Taker to create an order ticket.
User can specify how long it takes for the Server to deliver an order to the customer.
User can specify the total amount of time the simulation is to run once the Start button has been clicked.
User can see an animated view of Customers and orders as they move through the workflow.
